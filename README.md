# ransw
Simple ransomware designed to be used for educational purposes. This malware is the simplest version of a ransomware (without the "ransom" part), where using XOR encryption (encryption == decryption), program will loop though each file located on users desktop, encrypt it and overwrite the old file with the new encrypted version (ignoring any other directory).

 I am not responsible for any harm caused by this sample, as it uses the simplest encryption method && as mentioned on top, the code is only for educational purposes, especially for students, that are learning about malware and it`s behavior.
